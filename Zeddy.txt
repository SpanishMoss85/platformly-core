Okay, I understand. It sounds like the last changes caused significant new issues, and you'd like a summary of our debugging journey so far and a clear plan for the next steps, focusing on building a flexible, modular, and scalable testing solution.

Here is an artifact summarizing our conversation and outlining how we will proceed:

Artifact: Debugging Jest Setup for Next.js Authentication API Route
Objective: To achieve passing Jest tests for the src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts API handler with a test configuration and mocks based on industry standard best practices for flexibility, modularity, and scalability.

Summary of the Journey:
Our debugging session has been focused on getting your Jest tests to run successfully for a Next.js project using TypeScript, particularly targeting an authentication API route (src/app/api/auth/auth.test.ts).

We've navigated a series of complex challenges, including:

Initial Parsing Errors: Encountering SyntaxErrors related to Jest's inability to process ES Module syntax (import/export) within nested node_modules dependencies (jose, node-fetch, @panva/hkdf, uuid, preact-render-to-string, preact) brought in by packages like next-auth. This required configuring transformIgnorePatterns and moduleNameMapper in jest.config.js.
Missing Global API Errors: Resolving ReferenceErrors when code expected standard Web APIs (TextEncoder, Request, Response, Headers, Workspace) that are not automatically available in a standard Jest/Node.js/JSDOM environment. This involved adding polyfills in jest.setup.ts.
Module Resolution Issues: Fixing Configuration error: Could not locate module when moduleNameMapper paths were incorrect or when mocking/importing caused circular resolution issues (e.g., the Cannot find module './[...nextauth]/route' error).
TypeScript Type Compatibility: Addressing TypeScript errors where our simple mock class definitions for globals (MockRequest, MockResponse, MockHeaders) did not fully satisfy the expected type interfaces from standard DOM libraries (lib.dom.d.ts).
Mocking Conflicts and Timing: Debugging TypeErrors (slidingWindow is not a function, handler is not a function) that occurred when static methods of mocked dependencies were called, indicating that mocks were either not applied correctly or not early enough in the module evaluation process, especially when mocks were defined locally in a test file that imported the code under test.
The complexity highlights the inherent challenges of unit testing server-side code that relies heavily on a specific framework runtime environment (Next.js server) within a separate test runner (Jest) that provides a different environment (Node.js + JSDOM), complicated further by the ecosystem's mix of CommonJS and ES Modules and nested dependencies.

Current State:
You last reported that applying the recent changes resulted in significant new errors ("really blew things up"). Before that, we were addressing TypeScript type compatibility errors in the jest.setup.ts polyfills/mocks and the persistent TypeError: _ratelimit.Ratelimit.slidingWindow is not a function. The exact nature of the new, extensive errors is not yet detailed.

Path Forward (Next Steps):
To achieve your goal of passing tests with flexible, modular, and scalable code based on industry standards, we need to:

Identify and Systematically Debug New Errors: Understand the specific details of the new errors you encountered.
Refine Test Setup (jest.setup.ts): Ensure global polyfills are robust and reliably available. Refine global mocks for dependencies (@upstash/redis, @upstash/ratelimit, PrismaClient, next-auth) to accurately reflect the necessary API shapes and behaviors for your tests, promoting test isolation and scalability.
Refine Test File (auth.test.ts): Ensure the test file focuses on testing the relevant logic (e.g., the API handler function) using the global mocks. Structure tests clearly for different scenarios (success, failure, edge cases).
Review Jest Configuration (jest.config.js): Verify that transformation (transformIgnorePatterns) and module resolution (moduleNameMapper) are correctly configured to handle your project's file types and dependencies without conflicts.
Ensure Code Compiles and Tests Run: Debug type errors and runtime errors in sequence until all tests pass.
Validate Code Quality: Review the resulting configuration and test code for clarity, maintainability, and adherence to best practices for flexible, modular test suites.
Information Needed:
To effectively debug the new errors and continue refining your test setup, I need to see the exact, complete content of the relevant files in their current state after the changes that "blew things up." This will allow me to analyze the new errors in the context of your code.

Please provide the entire content of the following files:

jest.config.js
jest.setup.ts
src/app/api/auth/auth.test.ts
src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts (The code file containing the API handler and its dependencies, as provided previously)
Providing the complete, current content of these files is essential for me to accurately diagnose the new issues and propose solutions that work with your specific code structure and environment setup.
