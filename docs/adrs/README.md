# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains records of significant architectural decisions made throughout the project. Each ADR documents the context, decision, and consequences of a specific architectural choice.

Using ADRs helps maintain a clear history of the system's evolution and the reasoning behind key design choices.

_See [adr-template.md](./adr-template.md) (to be created) for the standard format._
