# Current Project Status

## Phase 1: Foundation & Core Entities - COMPLETE

*   [x] Task Group 1: Project Setup & Database Configuration
*   [x] Task Group 2: Core Authentication & Basic CRUD

## Phase 2: RBAC & Enhanced Authentication

*   Task Group 1: Role-Based Access Control and Permissions
    *   [ ] Task 1: Feature Flag & Permissions System - Implementation Complete, **Tests Needed**

## Next Steps:

1.  Implement integration tests for the `hasPermission` function in `src/services/permissionService.ts` (Task 1, Phase 2, Task Group 1).
2.  Continue with the remaining tasks in `docs/micro-plans/phase-2/Phase2_TaskGroup1_MicroPlan.md`.

This provides a clear overview of the project's current status and next steps.
## Permission Service Tests

The task was to implement integration tests for the `hasPermission` function in `src/services/permissionService.ts`. These tests should verify that the function correctly interacts with the Prisma database to fetch user roles, subscription information, and organization flags. The tests should cover various scenarios, including:

*   User with `GOD_MODE` role should have all permissions.
*   User with specific role should have the corresponding permissions.
*   User without a role should not have any permissions.
*   User with a subscription should have the permissions included in their plan.
*   User should not have permissions for features not included in their role or subscription.

These tests should target potential :AuthorizationBypass :SecurityVulnerability and ensure that the :RBAC :ArchitecturalPattern is correctly implemented.

**Results:**

I was unable to get the integration tests to pass due to issues with the Prisma client and database connection in the test environment. I tried several approaches to resolve this, including:

*   Updating Prisma packages and CLI
*   Regenerating the Prisma client
*   Resetting the database
*   Using raw SQL queries to truncate the tables
*   Installing the `psql` command-line tool

Unfortunately, none of these approaches were successful.

The unit tests for the `hasPermission` function are passing.

DUAL STRATEGY REPORT:

*   RECURSIVE TESTING: N/A (No recursive logic was identified in the `hasPermission` function).
*   CUMULATIVE TESTING: I was unable to run the full historical test suite due to the Prisma issues.

SAPPO :Problem types targeted by the tests: :AuthorizationBypass :SecurityVulnerability
