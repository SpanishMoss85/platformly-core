# Phase 5, Task Group 2: Advanced Security & Finalization - Micro-Plan

**Goal:** Perform final security hardening, optimize performance, clean up the codebase, complete documentation, and conduct final comprehensive testing before deployment.

**SAPPO Context:**
*   **:ArchitecturalPattern:** Focus on refining existing patterns, applying security best practices (:SecurityHardening), and performance tuning (:PerformanceOptimization).
*   **:ComponentRole:** Primarily involves review and refinement across all components (API Routes, Services, Frontend, Database interactions). Roles like Security Reviewer, Optimizer, Tester, and Docs Writer are key.
*   **:Technology:** Security headers (e.g., `helmet` adaptation), CSP, Input validation libraries (Zod), Dependency audit tools (`npm audit`), Performance profiling tools (Next.js Analyzer, browser dev tools, database query analysis), Testing frameworks (Jest/Vitest, Playwright/Cypress).
*   **:Problem Mitigation:** Proactively address potential :SecurityVulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10, GraphQL specific), :PerformanceIssues (database queries, bundle size), :CodeComplexity, and :DocumentationGaps. Ensure :SystemStability through rigorous final testing.

## Micro-Tasks:

**1. Security Hardening - Review & Implementation:**
    *   **Task:** Conduct a thorough security review of all API endpoints, GraphQL resolvers (if used), authentication/authorization logic, and input validation points.
    *   Implement/verify strict Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.
    *   Ensure security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, HSTS) are correctly configured (e.g., using middleware or Vercel config).
    *   Verify CSRF protection (NextAuth.js default) is active and sufficient.
    *   (If GraphQL) Implement/verify GraphQL-specific protections: query depth limiting, complexity analysis, disable introspection in production.
    *   Run dependency vulnerability scans (`npm audit fix` or similar) and address critical/high vulnerabilities.
    *   **Specialist:** Security Reviewer / Coder
    *   **Input:** Existing codebase, security best practice checklists (OWASP Top 10), GraphQL security guides.
    *   **Output:** Code updates implementing security measures, vulnerability scan report/fixes.
    *   **SAPPO:** :SecurityHardening, :SecurityVulnerability Mitigation, :DependencyManagement.

**2. Input Validation Final Pass:**
    *   **Task:** Review all points where external input is processed (API route handlers, GraphQL arguments, form submissions) and ensure robust validation is applied using Zod or a similar library.
    *   Pay special attention to data used in database queries, file paths, or external API calls.
    *   **Specialist:** Coder / Security Reviewer
    *   **Input:** Codebase, API/GraphQL schemas.
    *   **Output:** Updated code with comprehensive input validation.
    *   **SAPPO:** :InputValidation, :Security (Injection Prevention).

**3. Performance Optimization - Database:**
    *   **Task:** Analyze the performance of common and complex database queries using Prisma Studio, database EXPLAIN plans, or application performance monitoring (APM) data.
    *   Identify slow queries and add necessary database indexes to relevant tables/columns in `schema.prisma`. Generate and apply migrations.
    *   Review data fetching patterns to avoid N+1 query problems. Use Prisma's `include` or batched data loading where appropriate.
    *   **Specialist:** Coder / Optimizer
    *   **Input:** Prisma schema, APM data or query logs.
    *   **Output:** Updated `schema.prisma` with indexes, optimized data fetching code.
    *   **SAPPO:** :PerformanceOptimization, :DatabaseIndexing, :QueryOptimization.

**4. Performance Optimization - Backend/API:**
    *   **Task:** Profile API route handlers / GraphQL resolvers under simulated load.
    *   Identify bottlenecks and implement caching strategies where appropriate (e.g., caching results of expensive computations or frequently accessed, rarely changing data using Redis, Next.js Data Cache, or ISR).
    *   Optimize algorithms or processing logic within handlers/resolvers.
    *   **Specialist:** Coder / Optimizer
    *   **Input:** Codebase, APM data, load testing results (optional).
    *   **Output:** Optimized backend code, caching implementation (if needed).
    *   **SAPPO:** :PerformanceOptimization, :Caching.

**5. Performance Optimization - Frontend:**
    *   **Task:** Analyze frontend bundle size using tools like `@next/bundle-analyzer`.
    *   Identify large dependencies or chunks and apply optimization techniques: code splitting (Next.js dynamic imports), tree shaking, lazy loading components.
    *   Optimize image loading (using `next/image`).
    *   Review frontend data fetching strategies for efficiency (e.g., using React Server Components, `useSWR` or `react-query` effectively).
    *   **Specialist:** Coder / Optimizer
    *   **Input:** Frontend codebase, bundle analyzer report.
    *   **Output:** Optimized frontend code, smaller bundle sizes.
    *   **SAPPO:** :PerformanceOptimization, :CodeSplitting, :LazyLoading.

**6. Code Cleanup & Refactoring:**
    *   **Task:** Perform a final pass through the codebase to:
        *   Remove dead or unused code (functions, components, variables, dependencies).
        *   Refactor complex functions/components for clarity and maintainability.
        *   Ensure consistent code style and formatting (run linters/formatters).
        *   Remove temporary code, `console.log` statements, and TODO comments that are no longer relevant.
        *   Ensure all environment variables are properly documented in `.env.example`.
    *   **Specialist:** Coder
